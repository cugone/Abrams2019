# Contributing to the project
We welcome any contributions you may have to the project.

Current areas lacking in features are:
- Linux OS support
- Physics Subsystem
- OpenGL Renderer

If you'd like to contribute, have a question, or would like to submit a feature request, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/cugone/Abrams2019/issues/new/choose) first so it may be discussed before any major work is done. You don't want to spend a lot of time on a feature only to have it rejected.

Please consider and follow the [Coding S&P](https://github.com/cugone/Abrams2019/wiki/Coding-Standards-and-Practices-with-Style-Guide) when making contributions.
