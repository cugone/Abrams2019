# Contributing to the project
We welcome any contributions you may have to the project.

Current areas lacking in features are:
 - Linux OS support
 - Physics Subsystem
 - OpenGL Renderer

If you'd like to contribute, have a question, or would like to submit a feature request, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/cugone/Abrams2019/issues/new) first so it may be discussed before any major work is done. You don't want to spend a lot of time on a feature only to have it rejected.

Please consider and follow the S&P below when making contributions.
 
## Coding Standards and Practices with Style Guide

This project follows a modified version of the [JSF-AV](http://www.stroustrup.com/JSF-AV-rules.pdf) rules and its descriptors:
 - Rules containing **may** are optional. They are not required and are a weak suggestion.
 - Rules containing **should** are advisory. They strongly suggest the way of doing things.
 - Rules containing **will** are intended to be mandatory. These rules are expected to have exceptions.
 - Rules containing **shall** are strictly mandatory. PRs breaking a **shall** rule are immediately rejected.

### Tabs vs Spaces
#### Rule 1
Tabs **will not** be used as a whitespace separator.

**Rationale:** Readability.

Tabs are system-dependent. Spaces are not. What is readable on your machine becomes an unreadable mess on a different computer when using tabs.

**Exceptions:**
 - Strings intended to be written to a file, parsed by XML, or input to a shader compiler **shall not** contain tabs or the `'\t'` character.
 - Strings intended for developer-only output such as outputting to Visual Studio's Output Window or formatting an error message **may** contain the `'\t'` character.
 - Specifications documenting the use of the `'\t'` character as a requirement **should** be followed. E.g. parsing HTTP header network packets
 
### Braces
#### Rule 2
Braces **shall** follow a variant of the One True Brace Style.

This is a modified K&R style (sometimes called Egyptian) where the opening brace is on the same line as the function signature or control block keyword and the closing brace is on its own line:
```
void foo() {

    {
        int some_local_variable = 0;
    }

    while(...) {
        if(...) {
        } else if(...) {
        } else {
        }
    }
}
```

**Rationale:**

Readability and Style consistency.

Scope blocks defined in this way can easily be converted to functions.

**Exceptions:**
 - Lambdas that are inline or very short **may** be on the same line:
 ```
 FunctionCallWithLambdaArgument([](...) {...});
 ```

#### Rule 3
Control blocks **shall** always be enclosed by braces even if the enclosing block is empty.

**Rationale:** Readability.

#### Rule 4
Empty control blocks **should** contain a comment that it is empty on purpose.
```
class Foo {
    public:
        virtual ~Foo() = 0;
};
//...
Foo::~Foo() {
    /* DO NOTHING */
}
```

**Rationale:** Readability

**Exceptions:**
 - Short Lambdas blocks **may** be empty.

#### Rule 5
Control blocks **shall** contain a space before the opening brace.

### Comments
#### Rule 6
Code **should** be readable and understandable without comments.

**Rationale:** Comments and function documentation go stale very quickly.

**Exceptions:**
 - Code **shall** document exceptions to rules or potentially confusing algorithms.

#### Rule 7
Multi-line comments **should** use C++-style comments:
```
//This is a comment
//that spans multiple lines
```

**Rationale:** C-style comments cannot be nested.

**Exceptions:**
 - Block comment separators within a file or file headers **may** use C-style comment blocks:
 ```
 /***************************************
 *  THIS FILE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK  *
 ****************************************/
 ```
 ```

 ```

#### Rule 8
C++-style comments **will not** contain a leading space between the comment designator and the comment.

**Rationale:** Style

**Exceptions**
 - Code **should** try to remain consistent within a single file.

### Indentation
#### Rule 9
All indentation **shall** be 4 spaces.

**Rationale:** Style

### Parenthesis
#### Rule 10
Control blocks **will not** contain a leading space between the control block keyword and the opening parenthesis:
```
if(a) {
    //...
}
[]() {}
```
**Rationale:** Style

**Exceptions:**
 - Code **should** try to remain consistent within a single file.

#### Rule 11
Parenthesis **may** be used to override order of operations even if the order is unchanged.

**Rationale:** Readability

### Functions
#### Rule 12
All free functions **will** have a corresponding function declaration at the top of the enclosing file where possible.

**Exceptions:**
 - In cases where the rule cannot be followed, such as user-defined types not being declared yet, or as part of a user-defined type interface, a function declaration **shall** be declared after and as close to the user-defined type's declaration as possible.

**Rationale:**
 - Readability.
 - Ease of finding the function.

### User-defined types (Classes)
#### Rule 13
The keyword `class` **shall** be used for any user-defined type that contains member functions.

**Rationale:** Style

#### Rule 14
Access modifiers for class **will** be declared in `public`, `protected`, `private` order.

**Rationale:** Readability

#### Rule 15
There **will** only be one declaration of each access modifier.

**Exceptions:**
 - More than one **may** be declared when used in conjunction with `decltype(auto)`.

### User-defined types (Structs)
#### Rule 16
The keyword `struct` **shall** be used for any user-defined type that contains only data members.

**Rationale:** Style

### Templates
#### Rule 17
Template parameter lists **shall not** contain the keyword `class`

**Rationale:** `typename` is more clear and must be used in cases where scope is involved.

#### Rule 18
Templates **shall not** be used if the only rationale for their use is reducing code duplication.

#### Rule 19
Explicit specialization as a form of customization for function templates **shall not** be used.

Use normal function overloading instead.

**Rationale:**
 - Does not play well with overloads.
 - See Walter E. Brown's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIDEjY5ywqU) on the subject of templates.

### Miscellaneous
### Rule 20
The keyword `typedef` **shall not** be used.

**Rationale:** It has been replaced by `using`

### Rule 21
The keyword `volatile` **shall not** be used as a thread-safe construct.

**Rationale:** Replaced by `std::atomic` and the various critical section lock types.
